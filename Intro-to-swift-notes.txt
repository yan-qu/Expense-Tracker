Ch.2 Naming

To be a better programmer, it is important to keep in mind that the program you write needs to be understandable not only for you, the programmer, but also others who are reading the program.

Use the camalNamingConvention

In swift, you can use emoji to name variables! 🤪

let is used to declare a constant

declare-initialize-use

think carefully about each name you use

Ch.3 String

Unicode is an international standard that can represent almost any character from any language in a standard way.

let welcomeString = "Hello \(firstName), welcome to \(city)"
\(variableName) is used as a blank space holder

\ backslash is an escape character to denote special punctuation/symbols used

”swift files. These tell your app what to do, and when and how to do it. ​ You edit these files by typing Swift code (which should feel familiar after ​ all your practice in Swift playgrounds).
.storyboard files. Storyboard files tell your app where to display information on the screen. Xcode opens them in a special environment called Interface Builder. You edit these by clicking, dragging, and choosing options in the utilities area.

Aspect Fit for photos, which fits the image inside the view without stretching or squashing it.”

Ch.6 Functions

Declare function using func

Application Programming Interface, more commonly known as an API.

An API is a specific set of functionality that can be used by a software developer to accomplish a task.

Ch.7
Let declares a constant, while val denotes a variable
Good programming practice: if something doesn't need to be changed, always use constants to avoid mistakes.

Ch.9 Types
can annotate (clarify) the type by using the following syntax: 
let annotatedDouble: Double = 20

The names of types use UpperCamel NamingConvention

can import Foundation and let today = Date() which will show current date and time

CH 10 Parameter

syntax for functions with parameter
func hello(name: String) {
    print("Hello " + name)
}

--> for returning a value
func spaceAvailableMessage(eachVideoDuration: Int, numberOfVideos: Int) -> String {
    let currentSpace = 10000
    let megabytesPerVideoSecond = 3
    let spaceAvailable = currentSpace - eachVideoDuration * numberOfVideos * megabytesPerVideoSecond

    return "If your \(numberOfVideos) videos are \(eachVideoDuration) seconds each, you'll have \(spaceAvailable) MBs remaining"
    
    The names you see when calling a function (and passing in one or more arguments) are called argument labels.

The names used inside the function (the values that have been received) are parameter names.

use a _ to denote you don't need a parameter name
func printHelloTo(_ name: String) {
    print("Hello " + name)
}
printHelloTo("Maya")
}

ch 12
It’s often useful to know if a string begins with another string. The method hasPrefix() can answer this question.

Methods VS Properties: methods like functions (able to alter things, has arguments etc.) properties like a characteristic of the instance (isEmpty, getting and setting values etc.)
