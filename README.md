# Expense-Tracker
A personal expense tracker on cellphones to facilitate easy and quick entries of daily expenses

Description: This project is meant to be an iOS application that can be downloaded and used to record daily expenses. Users are able to place each of their expenses into personalized categories, which are setup during the users' initial use of the application. The main page should only ask for the users' entries on the amount spent and the category into which the user wishes to put the expense. The other page, contains updated analysis on the expense.

Installation: Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

Usage: The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

Contributing: Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.

Credits: Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.

License: Finally, include a section for the license of your project. For more information on choosing a license, check out GitHub’s licensing guide!
